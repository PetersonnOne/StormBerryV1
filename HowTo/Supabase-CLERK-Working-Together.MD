I Setup Supabase to work with Clerk:

Clerk handles the Authentication logic and flow, and then passes its Clerk JWTs to Supabase, which in turn uses it to validate Users so they can access, and use Supabase as a backend database: 

**********************************************
Supabase Setup (to accept Clerk JWTs)

In your Supabase JWT settings â†’ you configure it to trust Clerk.

Youâ€™ll paste Clerkâ€™s JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) URL into Supabase dashboard so it can validate Clerkâ€™s tokens.

Supabase docs on this:

How I Setup My Project to Use Clerk and Supabase (Please note these URLs may Change as Supabase and Clerk may Update their URLs from time to time:

1. I went to my Supabase Project Using this URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[Put your Supabase Project URL Here and remove these Brackets]/auth/third-party

2. Click on the "Add provider" button this will load up a Popup List of options, Find and Select Clerk, and an "Add new Clerk connection" Modal will Popup

3. I will advise that you login to your Clerk Account first for this part:
A. In the "Add new Clerk connection" Modal Popup, you should see:
- Register your Clerk domain. Visit Clerk's Connect with Supabase page to configure your Clerk instance. This is the link you can click on that Hyperlink: https://dashboard.clerk.com/setup/supabase.

Then below that you will see: 
- An Input box labeled "Clerk Domain" This is where you are to enter your Clerk Project/Account Domain or just go to https://dashboard.clerk.com/setup/supabase which will open the Clerk Web Portal with your Clerk Account 
- Under 1. Select your instance: Select Your Organization and then Select Application. 
- Then select if you currently wnat to use Clerk for Development or Production Instance
- Under 2. Enable the Supabase Integration: Then click the button
- Under 3. Populate your Clerk domain in Supabase: And under the label "Clerk domain" copy the URL like: https://relaxed-marmotter-1875.clerk.accounts.dev
- This will automatically connect your Supabase Project with your Clerk Project, on the Clerk side.

B. Then come back to the Supabase "Add new Clerk connection" Modal Popup then paste the URL you copied from your Clerk Instance setup into the Input box labeled "Clerk Domain".
- Then click the "Creat Connection" Button.
