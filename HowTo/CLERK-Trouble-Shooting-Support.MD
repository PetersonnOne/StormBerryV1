I was having issues with using the instructions CLERK-Implementation.MD due to Clerk and Next.js Pairing incompatibility, so the emailed me to make sure my I was up to speed using Clerk, so i used the opportunity to tell them my Challenges, and this was the reply from Clerk Support:


Thanks for reaching out

Here's some information that might be useful:

The compatibility challenges you experienced are often related to specific version pairings and SDK generations. Clerk has clear version requirements that can help avoid these issues in future projects.

For Next.js compatibility, @clerk/nextjs v5+ (Core 2) requires Next.js 13.0.4 or later, React 18+, and Node.js 18.17.0+. If you're using Next.js 12 or older, you'll need to use @clerk/nextjs v4 specifically with additional webpack configuration. The key is matching the right Clerk SDK version to your Next.js version - newer Clerk versions only support Next.js 13+ while older projects need the v4 SDK branch.

Check out these resources for version compatibility guidance: https://clerk.com/docs/upgrade-guides/core-2/nextjs, https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/usage-with-older-versions, and https://clerk.com/docs/versioning/available-versions

In general we recommend using our nextjs quickstart as that should not result in any compatibility issues and set up everything related to Clerk for you when using our provided LLM prompt.
