Next.js Type, Package Manager and Node Version

Next.js Router Type: App Router
Your project is using the App Router (not Pages Router). This is evident from:

The app/ directory structure with 
layout.tsx
 files
Next.js version 13.4.12 in your 
package.json
 (App Router was introduced in Next.js 13)
The presence of 
app/layout.tsx
 which is the App Router pattern
Package Manager: npm
Yes, you're using npm as your package manager. This is confirmed by the presence of package-lock.json in your project root.

Node Version
Your 
package.json
 doesn't specify a Node.js version requirement, but based on your dependencies:

Next.js 13.4.12 requires Node.js 16.14.0 or later
For Tempo.build, I'd recommend specifying Node.js 18 or Node.js 20 (LTS versions)
Summary for Tempo.build Setup:
Framework: Next.js (App Router)
Package Manager: npm
Node Version: 18 or 20 (recommended)
Build Command: npm run build
Start Command: npm run start
If Tempo.build asks for a specific Node version, choose 18.x or 20.x for best compatibility.
